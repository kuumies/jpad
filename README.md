# J-pad
A Japanese Text Editor

![J-pad running on OS X](/resource/osx_screenshot.png)

During my school days I used to love to use JWPce but that is a Windows-only software. One might say that this J-pad is a clone of JWPce altought at the moment J-pad is lacking of some usable features of JWPce.

Qt is used as the GUI library meaning the application can run on multiple operating systems (I use OSX).

J-pad has an integrated Japan-English-Japan dictionary (EDICT). The dictionary can also used to convert a hiragana/katana word/phrase into kanji/s.
